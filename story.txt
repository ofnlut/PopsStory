This is a story about a man name Pops. Pops was a young boy who really liked pizza. 
So much infact he had an addiction. One day his friends told him "Pops you must stop this at once!". 
But Pop's exclaimed "Never you can never stop me!", as he jumped out of a 3 story window.

Pops jumped into a large pizza that was created by the store below where he jumped for a world record contest.
He began eating it from inside the pizza where he had fallen. His friends and the store owner all stared in awe.

After winning what he thought was a world record, it actually turned out to be a universe record, and aliens came
down to congratulate him. He, along wth everyone else, had no clue what to say or do as they never would have expected
aliens to come over something as small as this. As a result, the aliens got mad as they thought the humans were
ignoring them.

Turns out, the aliens came from a planet which was made full of pizza.
People lived in homes made of pizza and also ate pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
After the aliens explained stuff about their planet, Pops wanted to go to the "PizzaWorld" with them.
The aliens told Pops that he had passed the exam by breaking the universal pizza record, but they still couldn't take him.
"Why?", Pops asked shockingly. The aliens said, "You need to first pass CS 400, its a prerequesite."  

So, Pops decided to switch his major from Mechanical Engieering to Computer Science.
After a few semesters he was able to finally reach the CS 400 class where he learned from Deb Deppler about pizza sorting.
He finished the class with a P+, and was finally able to leave Earth to go live with the aliens in the "PizzaWorld".
Pops ate pizza all day long and was truly happy.

The End
