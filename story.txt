This is a story about a man name Pops. Pops was a young boy who really liked pizza. 
So much infact he had an addiction. One day his friends told him "Pops you must stop this at once!". 
But Pop's exclaimed "Never you can never stop me!", as he jumped out of a 3 story window.

Pops jumped into a large pizza that was created by the store below where he jumped for a world record contest.
He began eating it from inside the pizza where he had fallen. His friends and the store owner all stared in awe.

After winning what he thought was a world record, it actually turned out to be a universe record, and aliens came
down to congratulate him. He, along wth everyone else, had no clue what to say or do as they never would have expected
aliens to come over something as small as this. As a result, the aliens got mad as they thought the humans were
ignoring them.
